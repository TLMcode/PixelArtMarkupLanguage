/// the C source file...

//REVISION: 2013-09-26 21:43:15 - joedf
// ------------------------------------------------------
// ADDED: a few free() memory in IPC function
//        Actual cause of the bug was not memory but Pamlviewer was
//		  Correctly managing Tempfile names using only time with seconds
//		  So clicking faster that 1 click/per second, would cause a "crash"
//		  because, the other file is already Open... so Paml veiwer will be
//		  updated accordingly.
